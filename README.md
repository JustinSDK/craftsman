I'm playing Minecraft recently. Here is a mod which helps when playing. It's based on forge-1.12-14.21.1.2387-mdk. 

Currently, there are following commands: 

- Building
    - `pyramid`
    - `stairs`
    - `maze`

- Drawing
    - `cube`
    - `frame`
    - `turtle`
    - `line`

The following picture shows pyramids generated by the `pyramid` command.

You may be a turtle to `draw' your building.

Do you want to challenge mazes?

I'll provide more docs if the mod is more stable.
