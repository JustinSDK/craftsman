I'm playing Minecraft recently. Here is a mod which helps when playing. It's based on forge-1.12-14.21.1.2387-mdk. 

Currently, there are four commands: 

- `build`
- `destroy`
- `empty`
- `pyramid`

The following picture shows pyramids generated by the `pyramid` command.

I'll provide more docs if the mod is more stable.
